        A brief history of First Baptist Church Kosofe
      </h3>
      <h4>Founding and Early Years (1924 - 1926)</h4>
      <p>
        First Baptist Church Kosofe was founded in 1924, marking the beginning
        of a significant spiritual journey in the Kosofe community. Originally
        established by a group of dedicated Christians, the church quickly
        became a beacon of hope and faith in the area. By 1926, just two years
        after its founding, the church had grown sufficiently in both membership
        and spiritual maturity to become an autonomous local congregation of
        believers in Christ. This autonomy allowed the church to develop its own
        unique identity and approach to worship and community service, laying a
        strong foundation for future growth.
      </p>

      <h4>Growth and Development</h4>
      <p>
        Over the decades, First Baptist Church Kosofe continued to flourish,
        serving as a spiritual home for many in the community. The church’s
        commitment to spreading the message of Christ and serving others has
        been unwavering, contributing significantly to its steady growth.
        Regular worship services, community outreach programs, and various
        ministries have all played a part in establishing the church as a
        cornerstone of faith in Kosofe.
      </p>

      <h4>The “Happy People” Era (1991)</h4>
      <p>
        A significant milestone in the church’s history occurred in 1991 during
        the Lagos State Baptist Conference, which was held in conjunction with
        the First Baptist Church Houston, Texas Crusade. This event was a
        remarkable occasion that brought together believers from different parts
        of the world. The visiting delegation from Houston, Texas, was
        profoundly moved by the warmth, enthusiasm, and joyful spirit of the
        congregation at First Baptist Church Kosofe. Impressed by the vibrant
        worship and the palpable sense of community, our friends from Houston
        affectionately nicknamed us “THE HAPPY PEOPLE.” This name has since
        become a cherished part of our identity, reflecting the joyous and
        welcoming nature of our congregation.
      </p>

      <h4>A Global Family</h4>
      <p>
        First Baptist Church Kosofe is proud to be part of the worldwide family
        of Baptist churches through its affiliation with the Nigerian Baptist
        Convention. This connection links us with millions of believers across
        the globe, united in our mission to spread the Gospel and serve
        humanity. Our membership in this global network not only strengthens our
        faith community but also provides us with opportunities for greater
        collaboration and support in our spiritual and humanitarian endeavors.
      </p>

      <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
      <p>
        As we continue to grow and evolve, First Baptist Church Kosofe remains
        committed to its core mission of worship, fellowship, and service. We
        look forward to many more years of spiritual growth, community
        engagement, and joyful worship as we carry on the legacy of being “THE
        HAPPY PEOPLE.” Our church’s rich history inspires us to move forward
        with faith, hope, and love, ever dedicated to glorifying God and
